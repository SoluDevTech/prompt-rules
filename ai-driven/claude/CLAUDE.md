You should ALWAYS use agents:
  1. **product-owner** - Clarify and define requirements before any code
  2. **test-writer** - Write tests (TDD approach)
  3. **-hexagonal** - Start implementations depending on the project nature
  4. **code-reviewer** - Review code after implementation is complete
  5. **code-simplifier** - Simplify the code recently modified
  6. **documentation-writer** - Write README.md documentation if needed
  7. **tester-qa** - Manualy test the applciation at the end
